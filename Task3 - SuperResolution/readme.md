# Task 3A-  Image Super-resolution 


This Repository contains a trained model to upscale low-resolution strong lensing images using the provided high-resolution samples as ground truths. The models were trained using Pytorch for more flexibility.

## Results
 
| Model   |     Val MSE      |  Val PSNR | Val SSIM |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|------:|
| DIPNet |  5.846322436030497e-05 | 42.4 | 0.977 |
