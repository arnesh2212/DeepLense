# Task 3A-  Image Super-resolution 


This Repositry contains trained model to upscale low-resolution strong lensing images using the provided high-resolution samples as ground truths. The models were trained using Pytorch for more flexibilty.

## Results
 
| Model   |     Val MSE      |  Val PSNR | Val SSIM |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|------:|
| DIPNet |  5.846322436030497e-05 | 42.364 | 0.9767 |


### Trained Model weights are present in this Repositry
### Reference - https://github.com/xiumu00/DIPNet
### DIPNet Is a effecient algorithm which provides expectional performance for Less Compute Power
### Other Models that were tried are - ESRGAN , SRGAN , SRCNN and SRResnet
